# Gradient-Descent-Test

The purpose of this repo is just testing for Gradient Descent. If you want to play around with it
just run the requirements.txt in terminal using
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and change the function in main.py and update the parameters accordingly and you
will have your result and you will be able to see how GD minimizes a convex function to get to the minima.
